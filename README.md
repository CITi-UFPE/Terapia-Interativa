A repository to keep all proofs of concept necessary for the tech documentation. For more information about the technical documentation, please visit [the Notion page](https://www.notion.so/citiufpe/Documenta-o-T-cnica-e3546b617c4148c6883c48124cbc847a).

## Video call API
The video call API used here was the [Vonage video API](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/video/?icmp=l3nav_overview_novalue). It is an excellent api, that includes `video, screen sharing and broadcast`, `recording`, `security and compliance`, `end-to-end development assistance`. It's documentation is super easy to comprehend and it's pricing is very competitive when compared to others, like the [Eyeson video API](https://www.eyeson.com/developers/).
